# Streams Prefetcher Project Rules

## Docker Container Management

When restarting the container after making changes:
1. Navigate to `/opt/docker`
2. Run: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=streams-prefetcher docker compose up -d --build streams-prefetcher`

This ensures the container is properly rebuilt and restarted with the correct profile configuration.
